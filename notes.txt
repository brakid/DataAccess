Data access
* access to datasets only if you have the token for it
* purchase token
* each dataset costs x amount of tokens
* people that have provided their Images into a dataset will earn tokens for providing their Data into the dataset
* cost of a dataset depends on size, each record pays 1 unit (different pricing schemes per Data type?)
    * text data first
* record
* start with 1 dataset first
* genererate dataset depeding on requested size -> shuffle(?), pay all data providers (?) or just the ones whose Data is in the set?
* no manual data Insertion, but you grant access to ? FB, Google, WhatsApp?

User: uploads a record (verify it is not in the set yet)
If successful upload: receive a DataProviderToken (transferable?) linked to the record
1) tokens not linked to records:
* when someone downloads a dataset with size x, they pay x in DataAccessTokens (burn), receive a one-time code? Or do they receive an NFT?
1.1) they receive a code:
 * can download the dataset once from the backend, after it: code is invalid
 * code is public key encrypted and contains dataset size & purchaser address (how to make it safe)
* DataAccessTokens are backed by some other token -> distributed to DataProviderToken holders (claimable)

* burn DataProviderTokens
1) not possible
2) possible if tokens are linked to records

* DataAccessToken is the currency
* DataProviderToken is like shares in a pool (decisions on max number of records in datasets, mininum number of records, fees)
